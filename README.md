Givenchy Sustainable Packaging Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes how sustainable packaging attributes influence consumer evaluation in the decorative cosmetics segment. The study is based on a real-world marketing research case involving Givenchy and focuses on identifying which packaging features drive buying preference and perceived sustainability.

The analysis was conducted as part of a Multivariate Statistics course and applies statistical techniques to transform consumer preference data into actionable insights for sustainable packaging design.

Foundation of the Project

The foundation of this project lies in a consumer preference study where participants evaluated cosmetic packaging designs that varied in material, sustainability labels, functional features, color, and price. The objective was to understand how consumers trade off sustainability-related cues against price and other design elements.

Using a rating-based conjoint approach, the project decomposes overall consumer evaluations into the contribution of individual packaging attributes. This allows the identification of sustainability features that meaningfully influence buying preference and willingness to pay in a luxury brand context.
